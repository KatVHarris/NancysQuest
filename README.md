## Construct2
Construct2 is a HTML5 game creator that uses powerful event systems to allow anyone to make games without coding. The engine uses Layouts paired with Event Sheets to control different Objects in the game. Layouts hold all the objects that will appear in a game. Event sheets are run in order. So if a command at the top of the page is run before one that follows it. All events are numbered. There are comments in the Main Event sheet explaining what the event does.
